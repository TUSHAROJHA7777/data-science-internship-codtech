## üß™ What the Notebook Does

1. Loads and explores the Fashion MNIST dataset
2. Normalizes and preprocesses image data
3. Builds a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras
4. Trains the model with training data
5. Evaluates accuracy on test data
6. Predicts and visualizes classification results

---

## üìä Accuracy

Achieved around *88‚Äì90% test accuracy* after 10 epochs using a simple dense neural network.

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open in VS Code, Jupyter, or Google Colab
2. Run cells from top to bottom
3. You‚Äôll see predictions and performance results at the end
